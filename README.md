PKs Rebalancing Mod for C:DDA readme

  Thanks for downloading the mod, and even moreso for taking the time to read a readme.  Im personally hit and miss with which readmes I even bother to look at nowadays.
  
  This readme's purpose is to document the changes I make to the mod; the larger ones for sure and sometimes the smaller ones.  There was no readme for versions below 1.00, since most of that can be found at the cataclysm github 
                         https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA
                         
  This mod, as Im sure you are aware by now, overhauls all the little things about C:DDA to make it a new experience while still using the old mechanics.  Its harder to survive, sure, but not because I directly made it harder to dodge or I did some magic to the code.  I strictly only use JSON to update the game.
