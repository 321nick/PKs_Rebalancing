    "description":"You don't know what this thing is, but the ants treat it as one of their own.  Its head looks like a maggot, completely devoid of pincers and with three beady eyes staring in different directions.  While it typically travels on its four limbs, it occasionally stands upon its hind limbs to gaze about.  It claws clumsily with the three digits on each limb, and rumors exist of it being capable of harnessing electricity for attack.",
